#  AIxplore — AI-Powered Travel Exploration (MVP)

AIxplore is an **AI/ML-driven travel recommendation MVP** designed to demonstrate how semantic search and user preferences can be used to generate smart itineraries and travel suggestions.  
This project focuses on **architecture, ML integration, and backend–frontend flow**, not a production-ready product.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a **proof-of-concept AI system** that:
- Understands user intent (traveler type, stay duration, budget)
- Recommends relevant places using semantic similarity
- Generates a basic day-wise itinerary
- Demonstrates real-world AI/ML + backend integration

---

##  Key Features (MVP Scope)

-  **Semantic Place Recommendation**
  - Uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to understand meaning instead of keywords
  - Recommends places based on traveler intent (Explorer / Foodie / Shopaholic)

-  **Smart Itinerary Generator**
  - Suggests places optimized for short stays (e.g., 1-day trip vs multi-day)
  - Dynamically adapts recommendations based on user inputs

-  **Streamlit-Based UI**
  - Multi-page layout (Login, Home, Itinerary, Upload)
  - Simple block-based navigation for clarity

-  **Modular Backend Architecture**
  - Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data layer
  - Easily extendable for maps, image understanding, or OTP login
